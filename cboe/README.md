# cboe

## SELF REMINDER:

The function `convert` from cboe_to_csv takes in two parameters: Ticker and number of months (int)
Where `1` indicate the current month and 2 the next one and so on.

After calling it a csv will be ready in the same directory with all the options (puts and calls) of the chosen month
